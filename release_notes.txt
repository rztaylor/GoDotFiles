## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Safer Apply for Risky Scripts**: `gdf apply` now warns and asks for confirmation when app hooks or install scripts look high risk (for example remote script pipe-to-shell patterns).
- **Rollback Command**: Added `gdf rollback` so you can undo the latest apply changes and recover files from captured history.
- **Targeted File Recovery**: `gdf rollback --target <path> --choose-snapshot` lets you restore a specific file and choose from dated historical versions.
- **More Flexible Conditional Dotfiles**: Dotfile conditions now support boolean expressions (`AND`/`OR`) and parentheses.
- **Better Cross-Platform Dotfile Targets**: Dotfiles can now cleanly map different target paths per OS from a single app definition.

### Changed
- **Improved Shell Startup Setup**: Generated shell integration now includes startup initialization for supported tools, reducing manual shell config edits.
- **Expanded Base Recipe Experience**: Common tools like `direnv`, `starship`, `zoxide`, and `fzf` now work with less manual shell setup.
- **Stronger File Safety During Apply**: GDF now keeps historical file copies before destructive replacements, improving rollback reliability.
- **Snapshot Retention Control**: Added `history.max_size_mb` (default `512`) so users can tune how much disk space history snapshots can use.
